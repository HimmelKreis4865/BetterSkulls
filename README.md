# BetterSkulls
An advanced Skull plugin for PocketMine-MP that allows spawning the heads of other players as blocks!

## Features
- [x] Breakable SkullBlocks
- [x] No unhandled place - faces are allowed, you can only place them on the ground
- [x] Fully customizable! All messages & the cooldown can be changed
- [x] Doesn't really influence other game behaviour - you just won't get a skull dropped from a skull that was not made with this plugin
- [x] Despawns on liquid flooding
- [x] Also 128px and higher resolution support
- [X] Player blacklist [by [supercrafter333](https://github.com/supercrafter333)]
